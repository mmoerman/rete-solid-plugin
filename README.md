Rete SolidJS Plugin
====

This is a Rete plugin for the [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) front-end framework.
It was inpired by the plugins already created for Rete by the Rete team, more specifically the 
[Rete React plugin](https://github.com/retejs/react-plugin)

The plugin uses the following to dependencies

- [solid-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solid-js): Base SolidJS framework
- [solid-styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solid-styled-components): Used to create easily styled 
components like react's styled-compnents

The library is in its Alpha stage, I am not a guru in SolidJS development, so I used some AI help and some 
reasearch to get this done.
I've been converting some of the examples at https://retejs.org/examples to test whether my code is working
and so far seems to work.
